# Setup a new mac
This is my little script to setup a new mac from scratch.
The best way to figure out what is going on, is probably to look at the `setup.sh` script itself. You're probably going to want to change things.

Run `$ sh setup.sh`, and the script will guide you through the rest.

# Things to do manually

Use the `[manualSetup.taskpaper](manualSetup.taskpaper)` list for the things that need to be set up manually. (Taskpaper lists can be copy-pasted into [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), you can use the [Taskpaper app](https://www.taskpaper.com), or simply use it as a plain text file.)
